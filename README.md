## About The Project

This project is a feature-rich dashboard that visualizes a user's Spotify data in a clean, modern interface inspired by the official Spotify web player. It uses the Spotify API for secure user authentication and data retrieval, displaying personalized information like top artists and tracks.

The standout feature is a custom AI music analysis tool. By sending a user's listening data to the OpenAI API (`gpt-4o`), the application generates a sophisticated, beautifully worded narrative of their unique musical taste, offering insights that go beyond simple statistics.

This application was built from the ground up and successfully deployed to Vercel, demonstrating a complete development lifecycle from concept to a live, production-ready product.
